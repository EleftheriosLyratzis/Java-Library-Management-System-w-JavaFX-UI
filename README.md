Principal Axes of the Inventory Management System Project

This project is an Inventory Management System developed in Java using JavaFX for the graphical user interface and a Random Access File for data persistence. The system is designed to manage an inventory of books by providing functionalities to add, list, search, update, and delete book records. In order to offer a seamless user experience, the application integrates both robust backend file handling and an intuitive front-end interface.

At the core of the project is a well-defined Book class that encapsulates essential attributes such as title, author, ISBN, price, page count (for printed books), and file size (for electronic books). The use of fixed-length records in a Random Access File allows for direct record manipulation and fast data retrieval. On application startup, the file is scanned and in-memory indexes are built to map ISBNs and titles to their respective file positions. This indexing not only enforces the uniqueness of ISBNs but also supports rapid searching by multiple criteria.

The user interface is built with JavaFX and organized into several tabs—each dedicated to a specific functionality. The “Add Book” tab lets users input book details and ensures that data integrity is maintained by enforcing rules such as providing either a page count or a file size (but not both) and ensuring that ISBNs are unique. The “List Books” tab displays all records currently in the inventory, while the “Search Book” tab offers a flexible search functionality. Users can search by title, ISBN, or author using a drop-down menu that determines the search criteria. Once search results are displayed, a user can select a record to view and edit its details or delete it from the inventory.

The visual appeal of the application has been enhanced by employing an external CSS file. This file defines the styles for various UI components, such as backgrounds, fonts, and buttons, giving the application a modern and professional look. Stylish buttons with gradient backgrounds, rounded corners, and hover effects contribute to an overall improved user experience. Moreover, the project window has been configured to open in a larger size, ensuring that all elements are comfortably visible to the user.

This project exemplifies the integration of a user-friendly front end with a solid backend. The design decisions made include careful validation of user inputs, efficient file I/O through Random Access Files, and real-time updating of in-memory indexes to ensure consistency and performance. Together, these components create a robust and efficient Inventory Management System that meets the requirements set out for managing book records.
